# cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance
This terraform module will create an RDS instance and all required AWS resources. A KMS key is also created in order to enable encryption.

The RDS instance that is created uses a randomly generated name to avoid any conflicts. The default database created in the instance uses the same random identifier but can be overriden by the user.

The module also deploys the instance in Multi-AZ.

The outputs of this module should allow a user to connect to the database instance.


**IMPORTANT NOTE: From version 4.0, this module does not support Live-0 deployment. Be sure to use the previous one (3.1) is you need to deploy to Live-0.**

## Usage

```hcl
module "example_team_rds" {
  source = "github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance"

  // The first two inputs are provided by the pipeline for cloud-platform. See the example for more detail.

  cluster_name           = "cloud-platform-live-0"
  cluster_state_bucket   = "live-0-state-bucket"
  db_allocated_storage   = "20"
  db_instance_class      = "db.t2.small"
  db_iops                = "1000"
  team_name              = "example-repo"
  business-unit          = "example-bu"
  application            = "exampleapp"
  is-production          = "false"
  environment-name       = "development"
  infrastructure-support = "example-team@digtal.justice.gov.uk"

  providers = {
    # This can be either "aws.london" or "aws.ireland:
    aws = "aws.london"
  }
}

```

Some of the inputs are tags. All infrastructure resources need to be tagged according to the [MOJ techincal guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/standards/documenting-infrastructure-owners/#documenting-owners-of-infrastructure). The tags are stored as variables that you will need to fill out as part of your module.

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| rds_instance_endpoint | The connection endpoint in address:port format |
| rds_instance_address | The hostname of the RDS instance |
| rds_instance_port | The database port |
| database_name | Name of the database |

## Quick test for database access

Connection details exported in the Kubernetes secret can be parsed with
```
$ kubectl --context live-1 -n rds-test get secret rds-test-rds-instance-output -o json | jq -r '.data'
{
  "database_name": "...",
  "database_password": "...",
  "database_username": "...",
  "rds_instance_address": "...",
  "rds_instance_endpoint": "..."
}
```
base64decode with eg
```
$ kubectl --context live-1 -n rds-test get secret rds-test-rds-instance-output -o json | jq -r '.data[] | @base64d'
```
A Docker image containing the `psql` utility is available from [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-postgresql)  (preferable to the official one because it doesn't run as root) and can be quickly launched with
```
$ kubectl --context live-1 -n rds-test run --generator=run-pod/v1 shell --rm -i --tty --image bitnami/postgresql -- bash
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
I have no name!@shell:/$ $ psql -h cloud-platform-identifier.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com -U username databasename
Password for username:

```

## Access outside the cluster

When you create an RDS instance using this module, it is created inside a virtual private cloud (VPC), which will only accept network connections from within the kubernetes cluster.
So, trying to connect to the RDS instance from your local machine will not work.

```
+--------------+                   \ /                        +--------------+
| Your machine | -------------------X-----------------------> | RDS instance |
+--------------+                   / \                        +--------------+
```

If you need to access your database from outside the cluster (e.g. from your own development machine, or to perform a bulk data import), you can do so via the following steps:

1. Run a pod inside the cluster to forward network traffic to your RDS instance
2. Tell kubernetes to forward traffic from your local machine to the new pod
3. Access the database as if it were running on your local machine

So, the connection from your machine to the RDS instance works like this:

```
+--------------+             +---------------------+          +--------------+
| Your machine |------------>| Port forwarding pod |--------->| RDS instance |
+--------------+             +---------------------+          +--------------+
```

### Database Hostname/Credentials

The hostname and credentials for accessing your database will be in a kubernetes secret inside your namespace. You can retrieve them as follows:

```
kubectl get secrets -n [your namespace]

kubectl get secret [secret name] -n [your namespace] -o json

```

You will need to base64 decode the values from the secret. In general:

    echo [secret value] | base64 --decode

If you are exporting a database URL from your RDS kubernetes secret, it might have a value like this:

```
postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37

```

The database hostname is part between `@` and `:` In the example above, the database hostname is:

**cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com**

You will need this value to tell the port-forward pod where it should send network traffic.

### 1. Run a port-forward pod

There are several docker images designed to forward network traffic, but you need one which does not run as `root`. We will use [ministryofjustice/port-forward][port-forward-image] for this example.

NB: **The cluster pod security policy (PSP) will prevent any images from running a process as the `root` user, so docker images which expect to do this will not work.**

```
kubectl \
  -n [your namespace] \
  run port-forward-pod \
  --generator=run-pod/v1 \
  --image=ministryofjustice/port-forward \
  --port=5432 \
  --env="REMOTE_HOST=[your database hostname]" \
  --env="LOCAL_PORT=5432" \
  --env="REMOTE_PORT=5432"
```

### 2. Forward local traffic to the port-forward-pod

Now you need to forward network traffic from a port on your local machine to the port-forward pod inside the cluster.

```
kubectl \
  -n [your namespace] \
  port-forward \
  port-forward-pod 5432:5432
```

You need to leave this running as long as you are accessing the database.

### 3. Access the database

Now you can connect to the database as if it were running locally, on your machine.

If you are exporting a database URL from your RDS kubernetes secret, it might have a value like this:

```
postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37

```

You can use this URL to connect to your database via the port forward you have set up, but you need to replace the database hostname, (`cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com` in this example), with `localhost`.

So, if you were starting from the database URL above, the database connection command you will run on your local machine would be:

```
psql postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@localhost:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37
```

If you are exporting the database credentials separately, the command would be something like this:

```
psql \
  --host localhost \
  --port 5432 \
  --dbname [your database name] \
  --username [your database username] \
  --password
```

(You will be prompted to enter the database password, which you should get (and then base64 decode) from your kubernetes secret)

Please remember to delete the port-forwarding pod when you have finished.

```
kubectl delete pod port-forward-pod -n [your namespace]
```
